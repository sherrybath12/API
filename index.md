## Data Models

Data models are visual representations of an enterpriseâ€™s data elements and the connections between them. By helping to define and structure data in the context of relevant business processes, models support the development of effective information systems. They enable business and technical resources to collaboratively decide how data will be stored, accessed, shared, updated and leveraged across an organization.

This section depicts the major model classes and how they interact.
